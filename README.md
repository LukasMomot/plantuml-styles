## Running the examples
To install PlantUml please use tool called [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).
After the installation run the command line with the following command:

    choco install plantuml 

This repository contains a number of [examples](https://github.com/inthepocket/plantuml-styles/tree/master/examples) that are meant to test
the stylesheet in different scenarios. The recommended way to test these examples, is to use **Visual Studio Code** with the PlantUML plugin.
